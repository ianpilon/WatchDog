**How the Agent Decides**

**Evidence strength & pattern consistency:** Explicit Diminisher — repeated, clearly disruptive pattern that matches several checklist items (e.g., introducing new ideas **before** earlier ones are explored **and** over-riding the team member’s line of thought **and** an observable impact such as confusion or stalled progress).

**Frequency / intensity threshold:** Explicit — behaviour shows up often enough (or forcefully enough) that the transcript demonstrates a dominant “Idea Guy” dynamic.

**Observable or inferred impact:** Explicit — the transcript contains signs the team is overwhelmed, derailed, or stops contributing (e.g., “Okay, let’s drop what we were doing” or long silences).
