**How the Agent Decides**

**Evidence strength & pattern consistency:** Contextual/Subtle — individual cues that resemble a Diminisher behaviour but, in isolation, might still be harmless brainstorming. These are surfaced so the user can notice a potential trend.

**Frequency / intensity threshold:** Contextual — appears only a handful of times or with light intensity—possible but not proven dominance.

**Observable or inferred impact:** Contextual — impact isn’t obvious; we just see idea-bursts.
