# Customer Problem Analyst - Debugging Report

## Issue Summary

The Customer Problem Analyst application was experiencing errors in the pain point and friction analysis functionalities. When attempting to run these analyses, they would fail silently with empty error objects being logged to the console:

```
[ERROR] Error in pain point and friction analysis: {}
[ERROR] Pain Analysis failed: {}
[ERROR] Error running agent painExtractor: {}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, we identified the root cause as an **incompatibility between the recently added `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` parameter and the existing system prompts** that weren't fully adapted for JSON-only responses.

Specifically:

1. The **system prompts for the pain extractor and friction analysis agents** included explanatory sections and markdown formatting that weren't compatible with strict JSON response formatting.

2. When using the `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` parameter with GPT-4o, the model is forced to return valid JSON objects only, but the prompts weren't structured to account for this constraint.

3. This created a **dependency chain failure**:
   - The JTBD Gains analysis worked correctly with the response_format parameter
   - The pain extractor depends on the gains analysis but failed because its prompt didn't properly align with response_format
   - The friction analysis depends on the pain extractor and thus also failed

4. Additionally, we discovered a **secondary issue with transcript preprocessing** where validation of transcript formats was too strict and would fail for certain input formats.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Updated System Prompts

We modified both the `PAIN_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` in `jtbdPainExtractorAgent.js` and the `FRICTION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` in `frictionAnalysisAgent.js` to:

- Begin with a clear statement that the entire response must be a valid JSON object
- Restructure the instructions to be more concise and JSON-focused
- Remove markdown formatting (like **bold** text and bullet points)
- Explicitly state the exact JSON structure required
- Add a clear instruction to return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text

#### Example of Prompt Changes (Pain Extractor)

**Before:**
```javascript
const PAIN_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `
You are an expert Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) Pain Point Analyzer. Your task is to analyze the provided transcript and gains analysis to identify customer pain points and provide actionable insights. Follow these steps:

1. **Identify Pain Points**:
   - Extract specific pain points from the transcript.
   ...
```

**After:**
```javascript
const PAIN_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are an expert Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) Pain Point Analyzer. Your task is to analyze the provided transcript and gains analysis to identify customer pain points and provide actionable insights. Your entire response must be a valid JSON object.

Follow these analysis steps:
1. Identify Pain Points: Extract specific pain points from the transcript.
...
```

### 2. Improved Transcript Preprocessing

We enhanced the transcript preprocessing functionality in both agents to be more tolerant of different transcript formats:

- Instead of failing when transcript preprocessing doesn't validate correctly, we implemented a fallback approach:
  - First attempts normal preprocessing
  - If validation fails, uses a fallback approach that accepts the raw transcript
  - Creates valid metadata attributes to satisfy the validation requirements
  - Logs warnings instead of throwing errors

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

We significantly improved error handling throughout the system:

- Added detailed error logging with structured information including:
  - Original error message
  - Error stack trace
  - Input structure details
- Created enhanced error objects with context about the failure stage
- Improved error messages shown to users to include more context

## Code Changes

### 1. Pain Extractor Prompt Update

```javascript
// Updated PAIN_ANALYSIS_PROMPT in jtbdPainExtractorAgent.js
const PAIN_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are an expert Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) Pain Point Analyzer. Your task is to analyze the provided transcript and gains analysis to identify customer pain points and provide actionable insights. Your entire response must be a valid JSON object.

Follow these analysis steps:
1. Identify Pain Points: Extract specific pain points from the transcript.
2. Calculate Metrics: Count total pain points and critical pains.
3. Summarize CURSE Analysis: Provide average scores across all pain points.

...

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text or explanation`;  
```

### 2. Friction Analysis Prompt Update

```javascript
// Updated FRICTION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT in frictionAnalysisAgent.js
const FRICTION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are an expert Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) Friction Analyzer. Your task is to analyze a provided transcript to identify friction points that prevent the interviewee from making progress toward their primary goal. Your entire response must be a valid JSON object.

Analysis instructions:
1. Use the "Primary Goal" from the Primary Goal Analysis results (provided separately) as your reference point
2. If the Primary Goal is unavailable, infer it from the transcript and flag this inference
...

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text or explanation`;
```

### 3. Transcript Preprocessing Enhancement

```javascript
// Implementation of fallback transcript preprocessing in both agents
let preprocessed;
try {
  preprocessed = extractIntervieweeResponses(completeTranscript);
  
  if (!validatePreprocessing(preprocessed)) {
    console.warn('Transcript preprocessing validation failed, using fallback processing');
    // Create a simplified fallback preprocessed object
    preprocessed = {
      processedTranscript: completeTranscript,
      metadata: {
        totalLines: completeTranscript.split('\n').length,
        processedLines: completeTranscript.split('\n').length,
        processedLength: completeTranscript.length,
        responsesExtracted: 1,
        fallbackProcessing: true
      }
    };
  }
} catch (preprocessError) {
  console.warn('Error during transcript preprocessing, using fallback:', preprocessError);
  // Create a simplified fallback preprocessed object
  preprocessed = {
    processedTranscript: completeTranscript,
    metadata: {
      totalLines: completeTranscript.split('\n').length,
      processedLines: completeTranscript.split('\n').length,
      processedLength: completeTranscript.length,
      responsesExtracted: 1,
      fallbackProcessing: true
    }
  };
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

```javascript
// Improved error handling in both agents
try {
  // Analysis code
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error in pain point and friction analysis:', {
    message: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    name: error.name,
    cause: error.cause
  });
  // Create a properly structured error with details
  const enhancedError = new Error(`Pain analysis failed: ${error.message}`);
  enhancedError.originalError = error;
  enhancedError.details = {
    stage: 'pain_analysis',
    inputStructure: {
      hasTranscript: !!input?.transcript,
      hasGainsAnalysis: !!input?.gainsAnalysis,
      inputKeys: input ? Object.keys(input) : []
    }
  };
  throw enhancedError;
}
```

## Results

After implementing these changes, the Customer Problem Analyst application was able to successfully run the pain point and friction analysis functionalities end-to-end without errors.

These improvements made the system more resilient while maintaining compatibility with GPT-4o's JSON response requirements, ensuring that all analysis components can work together seamlessly.

## Lessons Learned

1. **When using `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` with GPT-4o**:
   - System prompts must be carefully structured to ensure they're compatible with JSON-only responses
   - Instructions should clearly specify that the entire response must be a valid JSON object
   - Markdown formatting should be minimized or removed entirely

2. **Error handling best practices**:
   - Always preserve detailed error information
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for non-critical failures
   - Log structured error data rather than just the error object

3. **Robust preprocessing**:
   - Input validation should be flexible enough to handle a variety of formats
   - Graceful fallbacks should be provided for unexpected input formats
   - Clear logging should be added to help diagnose preprocessing issues

## Future Recommendations

1. **Review other agents' prompts** for similar JSON compatibility issues
2. **Add unit tests** specifically for transcript preprocessing edge cases
3. **Implement more robust validation** throughout the application
4. **Add telemetry** to track frequency and types of fallback processing being used
