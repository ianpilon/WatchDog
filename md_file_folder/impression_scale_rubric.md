The analysis assigns one of four overall impressions based on cumulative points earned from all subtle cues in the transcript.

 
+
**Points come from three dimensions per cue:**

1. **Pattern strength** ─ how closely the cue matches a specific behavior pattern (+1 pt)
2. **Frequency / intensity** ─ appears 3 + times **or** is notably forceful (+1 pt)
3. **Impact** ─ coincides with silence, derailment, or idea abandonment (+1 pt)

| Label | Point Range | Interpretation |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Unlikely** | 0 – 2 | Few or ambiguous cues. Low confidence (< 25 %) that a diminishing pattern exists. |
| **Possibly** | 3 – 4 | Some subtle cues but evidence is limited or inconsistent (≈ 25 – 50 % confidence). |
| **Likely** | 5 – 6 | Consistent subtle cues suggest a probable diminishing pattern (≈ 50 – 75 % confidence). |
| **Very Likely** | 7 + | Strong, recurring cues clearly indicate a diminishing pattern (> 75 % confidence). |

> The agent tallies points, then maps the total to the nearest band above to produce the **Overall Impression** you see in the Subtle-Cue Assessment card.
