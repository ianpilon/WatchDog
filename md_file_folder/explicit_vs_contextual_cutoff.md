# Explicit vs Contextual Cut-Off — How the Agent Decides

## Evidence strength & pattern consistency
- **Explicit Diminisher** — repeated, clearly disruptive pattern that matches several checklist items (e.g., introducing new ideas **before** earlier ones are explored **and** over-riding the team member’s line of thought **and** an observable impact such as confusion or stalled progress).
- **Contextual/Subtle** — individual cues that resemble a Diminisher behaviour but, in isolation, might still be harmless brainstorming. These are surfaced so the user can notice a potential trend.

## Frequency / intensity threshold
- **Explicit** — behaviour shows up often enough (or forcefully enough) that the transcript demonstrates a dominant “Idea Guy” dynamic.
- **Contextual** — appears only a handful of times or with light intensity—possible but not proven dominance.

## Observable or inferred impact
- **Explicit** — the transcript contains signs the team is overwhelmed, derailed, or stops contributing (e.g., “Okay, let’s drop what we were doing” or long silences).
- **Contextual** — impact isn’t obvious; we just see idea-bursts.

## How that applied to your quotes

> "What if we leaned into a totally different vibe for the campaign?"  
> "What if we partnered with a micro-influencer for Stories?"  
> "What if we pivoted the email to focus on community?"  
> "What if we did a pop-up event?"  
> "What if we targeted a totally different demographic?"

These lines are **idea bursts**, but the agent did **not** also see:

- frequent interruptions,
- the manager dismissing the subordinate’s own suggestions, or
- evidence that existing plans were abandoned.

Therefore they were logged as *subtle indicators* of a possible Idea-Guy tendency, but did **not** meet the stricter combination of criteria to assert an **explicit** diminishing pattern.

*(If the transcript had also shown the subordinate struggling to keep up, or the manager changing direction mid-conversation, the same quotes would likely have been elevated into the Explicit section.)*
