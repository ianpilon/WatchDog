# Understanding Impression vs. Confidence in Subtle-Cue Analysis

Here's a breakdown of the difference between "Overall Impression" and "Confidence" in the context of the Subtle-Cue Assessment card:

1.  **Overall Impression (e.g., 'Possibly' exhibiting 'The Idea Guy'...**)
    *   **What it is:** This is the *primary conclusion* of the subtle-cue analysis for the specific behavior pattern ("The Idea Guy" in this case). It rates how likely it is that the manager exhibited subtle signs of this pattern, based on the criteria defined in the **Impression Scale Rubric** (ⓘ).
    *   **How it's determined:** The analysis looks for subtle cues, assigns points (implicitly/approximately for contextual analysis), and maps the total to a rating like "No Evidence," "Possibly," or "Likely."
    *   **The percentage part (e.g., 25-50% confidence):** This percentage range shown *within* the Overall Impression text is part of the **definition** of that rating level according to the rubric. It explains *what "Possibly" means* in terms of the rubric's scale.

2.  **Confidence (e.g., Moderate)**
    *   **What it is:** This is the **AI's own assessment of how certain *it* is** about the "Overall Impression" it just gave. It's the AI reflecting on the quality of the evidence it used.
    *   **How it's determined:** The AI considers factors like: Were the subtle cues clear or ambiguous? Were there many examples or just one or two? Were there conflicting signals? Based on this, it assigns its own confidence level (High, Moderate, or Low), as detailed in the criteria table within its own ⓘ modal.
    *   **Analogy:**
        *   *Overall Impression:* "Based on the symptoms, it's **Possibly** the flu." (Diagnosis/Assessment)
        *   *Confidence:* "And I'm **Moderately** confident in that diagnosis." (Certainty about the diagnosis)

**In Simple Terms:**

*   **Overall Impression:** *What* the analysis thinks happened based on a scoring rubric.
*   **Confidence:** *How sure* the AI analyzer is about its own conclusion, based on the evidence quality.
